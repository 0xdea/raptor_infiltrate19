1. Abstract.

A buffer overflow in the DtPrinterAction::PrintActionExists() function in the
Common Desktop Environment 2.3.0 and earlier, as used in Oracle Solaris 10 1/13
(Update 11) and earlier, allows local users to gain root privileges via a long
printer name passed to dtprintinfo by a malicious lpstat program.

Note that Oracle Solaris CDE is based on the original CDE 1.x train, which is
different from the CDE 2.x codebase that was later open sourced. Most notably,
the vulnerable buffer in the Oracle Solaris CDE is stack-based, while in the
open source version it is heap-based.

This is a 0day vulnerability demonstrated at #INFILTRATE19 on May 2nd, 2019 in
the talk "A bug's life: story of a Solaris 0day".

2. Example Attack Session.

3. Affected Platforms.

All platforms shipping the Common Desktop Environment are potentially affected.
This includes:

* Oracle Solaris 10 1/13 (Update 11) and earlier [default installation]

According to the CDE Wiki, the following platforms are officially supported:

* All Official Ubuntu variants 12.04 - 18.04
* Debian 6, 7, 8, 9
* Fedora 17 at least
* Archlinux
* Red Hat
* Slackware 14.0
* OpenBSD
* NetBSD
* FreeBSD 9.2, 10.x, 11.x
* openSUSE Tumbleweed (gcc7)
* openSUSE Leap 4.2 (gcc4)
* SUSE 12 SP3 (gcc4)
* Solaris, OpenIndiana

4. Fix.

The maintainers of the open source CDE 2.x version have issued the following
patches for this vulnerability:

https://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/code/ci/30cd56ac389fbab521c52669a3bd25041d4e1df1/
https://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/code/ci/05d231606ebe3658712a36017d16ec3cc349145d/
https://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/code/ci/d59ec197e5307ad9650b6518dba67b7ef388f053/

Oracle, which maintains a different CDE codebase based on the 1.x train, has
assigned the tracking# S1153109 and has released a fix for all affected and
supported versions of Solaris in their Critical Patch Update (CPU) of July
2019.

As a temporary workaround, it is also possible to remove the setuid bit from
the dtprintinfo executable as follows:

bash-3.2# chmod -s /usr/dt/bin/dtprintinfo

5. Proof of Concept.

An exploit for Oracle Solaris 10 1/13 (Update 11) Intel has been developed as a
proof of concept. Exploits for other Solaris versions and for the SPARC
architecture are also available. All exploits can be downloaded from:
